//! Per-verb function modules and the single `register_all` entry point.
//! `main.rs` calls `register_all` after `register_worker`; each
//! `register_<verb>` below uses `RegisterFunction::new_async` with typed
//! `JsonSchema` request/response structs so the SDK can emit schemas for
//! tools and docs (docs/sops/binary-worker.md §7).
//!
//! WIRE-SURFACE CATALOG — `catalog()` below is the single source of truth
//! for every function's id + registration description, plus the
//! schemars-derived request/response schemas. The golden test
//! `tests/code_golden_schemas.rs` snapshots each entry so ANY change to the
//! agent-facing wire surface shows up as an explicit, reviewed diff.

const INFO_ID: &str = "coder::info";

     paths confined to the allowed roots; unjailed = deny-only, absolute \
     paths anywhere on the host, roots anchor relative paths only), \
     canonical allowed roots (primary first), the session_root that \
     relative paths actually anchor against when the session is scoped \
     (it overrides primary_root and may sit outside every allowed root), \
     per-file size caps, \
     response budgets (max_output_bytes, batch_read_budget_bytes, \
     search_response_budget_bytes), listing/search limits, the \
     non-accessible glob patterns, and the default_exclude_globs noise \
     filter applied by tree/search. Call this FIRST when unsure where \
     coder may read or write, or when a path was rejected — in jailed \
     mode, paths outside every allowed root need the shell worker's \
     shell::fs::* instead.";

const READ_FILE_ID: &str = "coder::read-file";
const READ_FILE_DESC: &str = "Read a file window-first: probe with stat: true (size/mtime/mode \

     with line_from/line_to (1-based, inclusive) — windows keep files \
     larger than max_read_bytes readable window by window, with \
     more_lines/total_lines reporting what remains. numbered: true \
     prefixes each line with its absolute 1-based file line number, \
     matching coder::update-file's line ops exactly. Full reads are \
     budgeted by max_output_bytes (default 128 KiB; per-call override \
     clamped to max_read_bytes) — an over-budget full read fails with \
     a C218 carrying the file's size, line count, and the window/stat \
     recovery calls. encoding: base64 (single-path full reads only) \
     returns the file's exact bytes base64-encoded — the binary-aware \
     read for images and other non-text payloads. Batch mode: pass \
     paths[] (XOR path) \
     to read multiple files in one call — entries are processed in \
     request order against batch_read_budget_bytes, measured in \
     bytes of returned content (after UTF-8 sanitization); per-entry \
     errors (C211/C218) leave other entries unaffected. Paths are relative \

     excluded from both content and path results. Only the FIRST match \
     on each line is reported (one content match per matching line). \
     Optional context_lines_before/context_lines_after (max 10) attach \
     surrounding lines to each content match so many edits can go \
     straight to coder::update-file with no read in between. Noise \
     paths matching default_exclude_globs (.git, node_modules, target, \
     … — coder::info lists them) are skipped by default; pass \

     than max_read_bytes are silently skipped during content scanning. \

     inclusive, applied bottom-up. Regex op: { op: 'replace', pattern, \
     replacement, ignore_case?, dot_matches_newline?, expect_matches? } \
     runs on the file body after line ops. Replace large regions \
     WITHOUT quoting them: two short anchors joined by .*? with \
     dot_matches_newline: true — always prefer wildcards over pasting \
     the block into the pattern. expect_matches: 1 turns a silent \
     multi-site clobber into a safe pre-write C210; expect_matches: 0 \
     asserts absence. In `replacement`, $1/${name} are capture \
     references and a literal $ must be written $$ (JS/TS template \
