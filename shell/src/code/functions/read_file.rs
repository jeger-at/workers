//! `coder::read-file` — return file content + metadata.
//!
//! **Single-path mode** (`path`): unchanged from T7 — full reads capped by
//! `max_read_bytes`; optional `line_from`/`line_to` switch to a windowed
//! streamed read. Non-accessible paths return C211.
//!
//! **Batch mode** (`paths[]`): read multiple files or windows in one call.
//! Each entry is a `ReadTarget`: a plain string (whole-file read) or an
//! object `{path, line_from?, line_to?}` (per-entry window). Entries are
//! processed in request order against a shared `batch_read_budget_bytes`
//! cap measured in BYTES OF RETURNED CONTENT (after UTF-8 sanitization —
//! invalid bytes expand to 3-byte U+FFFD replacements BEFORE they are
//! counted, so binary files can never deliver more than the budget). An
//! entry cut short by the remaining budget succeeds with `more_lines:
//! true`; an entry reached with zero budget gets a per-entry C218 (names
//! the config key + value, bytes consumed, and recovery guidance).
//! Per-entry resolution/glob/stat failures return per-entry C211; budget
//! is not consumed by failed entries.
//!
//! REDACTION INVARIANT (batch): error classification NEVER depends on
//! budget state — resolve + stat run BEFORE the zero-budget check, so a
//! missing path and a glob-denied path both return C211 (identical
//! wording, verbatim path echo) even after exhaustion. Only an existing,
//! accessible regular file may receive the budget C218.
//!
//! **XOR rule**: `path` XOR `paths` must be set; both or neither → C210.
//!
//! **S4 additions (v0.4.0)**: `stat: true` (single-path + per-entry)
//! returns metadata only — no content — with `total_lines`/`is_utf8`
//! counted via a bounded read (never more than `max_read_bytes`; null
//! beyond it, while size/mode/mtime still populate). `numbered: true`
//! prefixes each content line `N→` with its ABSOLUTE 1-based file line
//! number; prefix bytes are charged against every byte cap/budget.
//! Single-path FULL reads are additionally bounded by the
//! `max_output_bytes` config (per-call override clamped to
//! `max_read_bytes`); the C218 carries size + total_lines + the
//! corrective calls. REDACTION ORDERING everywhere: resolve → deny
//! (C211) → metadata syscalls → budget (C218) — classification must
//! never depend on budget state, and deny must precede any metadata
//! syscall so stat/budget can't become an existence or size oracle.
//!
//! **Binary reads**: `encoding: "base64"` (single-path FULL reads only)
//! returns the file's exact bytes base64-encoded — the binary-aware
//! read for payloads like images. The encoded length is charged against
//! `max_output_bytes`; C210 with `stat`/window/`numbered`.
//!
//! LINE CONVENTION (shared with `coder::update-file`): a line is a
//! 0x0A-terminated or EOF-terminated byte segment. An empty file has 0
//! lines; a trailing newline does NOT create a phantom last line. This
//! is exactly `str::lines()` counting — the same convention
//! `update_file::split_file` uses for its 1-based line ops — so line
//! numbers reported here address the same lines `update-file` edits.
//! (The two must not drift: agents read a window, then edit those line
//! numbers.) Windowed content keeps each line's raw terminator bytes.
